=== Get Quote Plugin ===

For certain WooCommerce shops, particularly those selling niche products or items that need to be procured only after a potential customer expresses interest, you might not want to reveal the product's price.

This plugin's functionality includes removing the 'add to cart' buttons from every page and also eliminating the price display. In lieu of the 'add to cart' button, a 'Get quote' button will be installed. This button will direct the customer to a form, facilitating the process of expressing interest in the product. Subsequently, an email stating this interest will be sent to you from the customer.

The plugin is fully compatible with the storefront theme and its variations. However, for other themes, it may be necessary to first eliminate the 'add to cart' and price features from the WordPress admin area.
